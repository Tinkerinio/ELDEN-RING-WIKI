# ELDEN-RING-WIKI
This project connected with WEB development. <br>
This is a Elden Ring Wiki created for WEB Techonologies course <br>
In this website you will see information about game, game mechanic (parry) and 2 webpages about bosses from the game <br>
I used some features, for example: account registration, pop up, changing day/night themes, filters, rating, date and etc. <br>
Project was provided by Yernazarov Alsalim, group: SE-2323
